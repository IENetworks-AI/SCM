# Supply Chain Management (SCM) Data Pipeline
## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a robust data pipeline for a Supply Chain Management (SCM) system. The goal is to ingest raw data, preprocess it, and prepare it for analysis and advanced modeling. This work is a core component of a larger initiative to leverage data science and AI for optimizing supply chain operations.

## Key Features
Automated Data Ingestion: Fetches raw SCM data from designated sources.

Data Preprocessing: Cleans, merges, and flattens the data to ensure consistency and quality.

Optimized ETL Pipeline: Utilizes Apache Airflow and Kafka to create an efficient and scalable ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process.

Model-Ready Datasets: Prepares and stores the processed data in a format suitable for downstream machine learning models, specifically for tasks like demand forecasting or logistics optimization.

## Technology Stack
The project is built with the following technologies:

Data Orchestration: Apache Airflow

Messaging Queue: Apache Kafka

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas for data manipulation, and various data-specific libraries.

Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x

Docker and Docker Compose (recommended for a simple setup of Airflow and Kafka)

## Installation
Clone the Repository:

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-scm-project.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-scm-project.git)
cd your-scm-project

## Set Up the Environment:
If using Docker, run the following command to start the Airflow and Kafka services:

docker-compose up -d

Configure the Pipeline:
Update the configuration files with your data source details and any other required parameters.

Running the Pipeline
Access the Apache Airflow UI to monitor and trigger the data pipeline.

Refer to the dags/ folder for the Airflow Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) that define the data workflows.
